<h2>Contributing to JBehave</h2>

<p>An open-source project thrives on users' contributions.  We welcome all contributions, from new features to enhancements and bugfixes.</p> 

<p>To propose a contribution: </p>

<ol>
<li>Open a new issue on <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JBEHAVE">JIRA</a> (a Codehaus login can be created at <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jbehave">Xircles</a>).</li>
<li>Clone the <a href="http://github.com/jbehave"> GitHub repo</a> of the appropriate project.</li>
<li>Commit your proposed changes to your cloned repo, using the issue number that you created above in the commit message, i.e. start all commits with "JBEHAVE-xxx:".</li>
<li>Update the issue with the links to the commits you made, which can be easily fetched and cherry-picked using git.</li>
</ol>

<span class="followup">For new ideas or solutions to your specific problems it is always recommended to first discuss them on the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing-lists</a>,
where you can get the full benefit of the experience of the JBehave community.  It may be that your problem can be already solved using existing functionality.</span>

<h2>Reporting Issues</h2>

<p>Users' feedback on issues and bugs is essential and welcome but in order to be addressed and fixed, the issues need to be reproducible.</p>

<p>To report an issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a new issue on <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JBEHAVE">JIRA</a>.</li>
<li>Provide a <b>self-contained sample project that reproduces your behaviour via command-line</b> - preferably using Maven but other systems are fine too.</li>
<li>The sample project should be sharable either in an archive form (jar, tar, zip) or - preferably - via your own <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> repo.</li>
</ol>

<span class="followup">Please avoid cutting & pasting or attaching bits of code and configuration to the JIRA issue as it makes it much more cumbersome to re-compose a 
working project. </span>
